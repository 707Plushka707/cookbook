Free Short Stories to Read Right Now

These individual short stories are the best of the best — and the even better news is that they're available for free online for you to peruse. From classics published in the 1900s to a short story that exploded in late 2017, here are ten of the greatest free short stories for you to read.
1. “Lamb to the Slaughter” by Roald Dahl

While not exactly a philosophical or political tale like our first two examples, this twisty short story from Dahl does delve into some shady moral territory. We are introduced to Mary Maloney: a loving wife and dedicated homemaker. In just a few short paragraphs describing how she welcomes her husband home, Dahli makes us sympathize with Mary — before a rash act turns her life upside down and takes the reader with her on a dark journey.

For those who haven’t read it, we won’t spoil the rest. However, it’s safe to say that Dahl serves up a fiendish twist on a platter.
2. “The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson

A perennial feature in many a high school syllabus, Shirley Jackson’s best-known short story clinically details an unusual ritual that takes place in a small town. There’s not exactly a lot of plot to spoil in The Lottery — but within a few short pages, Jackson manages to represent the mob mentality that can drive reasonable people to commit heinous acts.
3. “How to Become a Writer” by Lorrie Moore

Told in the second person point of view, this story from Moore’s debut anthology Self-Help takes an honest look at the inner life of a struggling artist. Through the use of an unusual POV, the author manages to turn her reader into a confidante — making it abundantly clear that the ‘you’ the narrator is speaking about is actually herself.

This story is a standout, but the entire collection is well worth a read for its insight, humor, and disregard for literary norms.
4. “Cat Person” by Kristen Roupenian

In the Social Media Age, no short story has gone viral the way this New Yorker contribution from Roupenian has. Arriving at the height of #MeToo, it begins with 20-year-old Margot embarking on the early stages of flirtation with an older man, Robert. As she gets to know more about this man (as well as filling in the gaps with her imagination), the power dynamic in their relationship starts to fluctuate.

Lauded for its portrayal of Margot’s inner life and the fears many modern women face when it comes to dating, it also has its fair share of detractors — many are critical of the central character, some are downright outraged by the story’s success. Still, this story undeniably struck a chord with the reading public, and will likely remain relevant for some time.
5. “Cathedral” by Raymond Carver

First published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1981, “Cathedral” is today known as one of Raymond Carver’s finest works. When it opens, we meet a narrator whose wife is expecting a visit from an old friend, a blind man. Dissatisfied and distrusting of people not like him, our narrator struggles to connect until the blind man asks him to describe a cathedral to him. 

 “Cathedral” is one of Carver’s own personal favorites, and deservedly so. His characteristic minimalist style is devastating as the story builds up to a shattering moment of emotional truth — an ultimate reminder that no-one else can capture the quiet sadness of working-class people like him. 
6. “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” by Flannery O’Connor

Innocuously titled, “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” is nevertheless Flannery O’Connor’s bleakest — and most famous — work. It begins unassumingly with a Southern family who’s planning to go on a road trip. Yet the journey is rudely interrupted when their car overturns on an abandoned dirt road — and they are met by an enigmatic group of three men, coming up over the far hill. 

This short story inspired some strong reactions from the public upon publication — and the conversation continues today as to its frank depiction of the nature of good and evil. Again, we won’t spoil anything for you, except to say that “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” is well worth your time. 
7. “Symbols and Signs” by Vladimir Nabokov

The famous author of Lolita wrote “Signs and Symbols” in 1948. Its premise is seemingly simple: an elderly couple visits their mentally ill son in the sanatorium in America. Yet their background and trials come into sharp focus as the story develops, until an explosive ending disrupts everyone’s peace of mind. 

As you might expect, the somber “Symbols and Signs” diverges sharply from Lolita in terms of both tone and subject — but its ending will keep you awake at night thinking about its implications.  
8. “Sticks” by George Saunders

Not so much a short story as it is flash fiction, “Sticks” is written from the perspective of a young man whose father has an unusual habit: dressing up a crucifix that’s built of out a metal pole in the yard. One of America’s greatest living short story writers, George Saunders explained: "For two years I'd been driving past a house like the one in the story, imagining the owner as a man more joyful and self-possessed and less self-conscious than myself. Then one day I got sick of him and invented his opposite, and there was the story." 

The result is a masterful piece of fiction that builds something out of seemingly nothing — all in the space of only two paragraphs. 
9. “The Veldt” by Ray Bradbury

If there’s anyone who you can trust to deliver thought-provoking, terrifying science fiction on the regular, it’s Ray Bradbury. In “The Veldt,” George and Lydia Hadley have bought an automated house that comes with a “nursey,” or a virtual reality room. Worried about the nursery’s effect on the kids, George and Lydia think about turning off the nursey — but the problem is that their children are obsessed with it. 

As an ominously prescient prediction of the downside of technology, “The Veldt” is a short and shining example of how Ray Bradbury was an author before his time. 
10. “Flowers for Algernon” by Daniel Keyes

In this classic short story, we are privy to the journals of Charlie Gordon, a cleaner with an IQ of 68. ("I reely wantd to lern I wantid it more even then pepul who are smarter even then me. All my life I wantid to be smart and not dumb.”) Charlie’s luck changes when he is selected for an experiment that purports to turn him into a genius — but everything that goes up must come down in the end. 

“Flowers for Algernon” won the Hugo Award in 1960 for its groundbreaking presentation. Heartbreaking and rich with subtle poignance, it is likely to remain a staple for centuries to come.  
Best Short Story Collections to Devour

If you'd like many short stories at your fingertips all at once, short story collections are where you should look. Here, we've collected 21 of the best short story collections — along with the standout story in each volume.

A Scandal inBohemiamyself in his power.  I have come incognito fromPrague for the purpose of consulting you.”“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting hiseyes once more.“The  facts  are  briefly  these:  Some  five  yearsago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made theacquaintance of the well-known adventuress, IreneAdler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” mur-mured Holmes without opening his eyes. For manyyears he had adopted a system of docketing all para-graphs concerning men and things, so that it wasdifficult to name a subject or a person on which hecould not at once furnish information. In this caseI found her biography sandwiched in between thatof a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commanderwho had written a monograph upon the deep-seafishes.“Let  me  see!”  said  Holmes.   “Hum!   Born  inNew Jersey in the year1858. Contralto—hum! LaScala, hum!  Prima donna Imperial Opera of War-saw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Livingin  London—quite  so!   Your  Majesty,  as  I  under-stand, became entangled with this young person,wrote her some compromising letters, and is nowdesirous of getting those letters back.”“Precisely so. But how—”“Was there a secret marriage?”“None.”“No legal papers or certificates?”“None.”“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this youngperson should produce her letters for blackmailingor other purposes, how is she to prove their authen-ticity?”“There is the writing.”“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”“My private note-paper.”“Stolen.”“My own seal.”“Imitated.”“My photograph.”“Bought.”“We were both in the photograph.”“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty hasindeed committed an indiscretion.”“I was mad—insane.”“You have compromised yourself seriously.”“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. Iam but thirty now.”“It must be recovered.”“We have tried and failed.”“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”“She will not sell.”“Stolen, then.”“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglarsin my pay ransacked her house. Once we divertedher luggage when she travelled. Twice she has beenwaylaid. There has been no result.”“No sign of it?”“Absolutely none.”Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little prob-lem,” said he.“But a very serious one to me,” returned theKing reproachfully.“Very, indeed.  And what does she propose todo with the photograph?”“To ruin me.”“But how?”“I am about to be married.”“So I have heard.”“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, sec-ond daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You mayknow the strict principles of her family. She is her-self the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubtas  to  my  conduct  would  bring  the  matter  to  anend.”“And Irene Adler?”“Threatens to send them the photograph. Andshe will do it.  I know that she will do it.  You donot know her, but she has a soul of steel.  She hasthe face of the most beautiful of women, and themind of the most resolute of men.  Rather than Ishould marry another woman, there are no lengthsto which she would not go—none.”“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”“I am sure.”“And why?”“Because she has said that she would send iton the day when the betrothal was publicly pro-claimed. That will be next Monday.”“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmeswith  a  yawn.   “That  is  very  fortunate,  as  I  haveone or two matters of importance to look into justat  present.   Your  Majesty  will,  of  course,  stay  inLondon for the present?”“Certainly.  You will find me at the Langhamunder the name of the Count Von Kramm.”“Then I shall drop you a line to let you knowhow we progress.”8
A Scandal inBohemia“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”“Then, as to money?”“You have carte blanche.”“Absolutely?”“I tell you that I would give one of the provincesof my kingdom to have that photograph.”“And for present expenses?”The King took a heavy chamois leather bag fromunder his cloak and laid it on the table.“There are three hundred pounds in gold andseven hundred in notes,” he said.Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of hisnote-book and handed it to him.“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’sWood.”Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,”said he. “Was the photograph a cabinet?”“It was.”“Then,  good-night,  your  Majesty,  and  I  trustthat we shall soon have some good news for you.And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheelsof the royal brougham rolled down the street.  “Ifyou will be good enough to call to-morrow after-noon at three o’clock I should like to chat this littlematter over with you.”CHAPTER II.At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street,but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady in-formed me that he had left the house shortly aftereight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside thefire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,however long he might be.  I was already deeplyinterested  in  his  inquiry,  for,  though  it  was  sur-rounded by none of the grim and strange featureswhich were associated with the two crimes which Ihave already recorded, still, the nature of the caseand the exalted station of his client gave it a charac-ter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of theinvestigation which my friend had on hand, therewas something in his masterly grasp of a situation,and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it apleasure to me to study his system of work, andto follow the quick, subtle methods by which hedisentangled the most inextricable mysteries.  Soaccustomed was I to his invariable success that thevery possibility of his failing had ceased to enterinto my head.It was close upon four before the door opened,and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputableclothes,  walked into the room.  Accustomed as Iwas to my friend’s amazing powers in the use ofdisguises,  I had to look three times before I wascertain that it was indeed he.  With a nod he van-ished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in fiveminutes  tweed-suited  and  respectable,  as  of  old.Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched outhis legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily forsome minutes.“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked andlaughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limpand helpless, in the chair.“What is it?”“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could neverguess  how  I  employed  my  morning,  or  what  Iended by doing.”“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have beenwatching the habits, and perhaps the house, of MissIrene Adler.”“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. Iwill tell you, however.  I left the house a little af-ter eight o’clock this morning in the character of agroom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathyand  freemasonry  among  horsey  men.   Be  one  ofthem, and you will know all that there is to know. Isoon found Briony Lodge. It is abijouvilla, with agarden at the back, but built out in front right up tothe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Largesitting-room on the right side, well furnished, withlong windows almost to the floor, and those pre-posterous English window fasteners which a childcould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable,save  that  the  passage  window  could  be  reachedfrom the top of the coach-house. I walked round itand examined it closely from every point of view,but without noting anything else of interest.9
A Scandal inBohemia“I then lounged down the street and found, asI expected, that there was a mews in a lane whichruns down by one wall of the garden.  I lent theostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, andreceived in exchange twopence, a glass of half andhalf, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much infor-mation as I could desire about Miss Adler, to saynothing of half a dozen other people in the neigh-bourhood in whom I was not in the least interested,but whose biographies I was compelled to listento.”“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads downin that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bon-net on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, toa man.  She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drivesout at five every day, and returns at seven sharpfor dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, exceptwhen  she  sings.   Has  only  one  male  visitor,  buta good deal of him.  He is dark,  handsome,  anddashing, never calls less than once a day, and oftentwice.  He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton,  of the InnerTemple. See the advantages of a cabman as a con-fidant.  They had driven him home a dozen timesfrom  Serpentine-mews,  and  knew  all  about  him.When I had listened to all they had to tell, I beganto walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more,and to think over my plan of campaign.“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an impor-tant factor in the matter.  He was a lawyer.  Thatsounded ominous. What was the relation betweenthem, and what the object of his repeated visits?Was she his client,  his friend,  or his mistress?  Ifthe former, she had probably transferred the photo-graph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely.On the issue of this question depended whether Ishould continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turnmy attention to the gentleman’s chambers in theTemple. It was a delicate point, and it widened thefield of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with thesedetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties,if you are to understand the situation.”“I am following you closely,” I answered.“I  was  still  balancing  the  matter  in  my  mindwhen  a  hansom  cab  drove  up  to  Briony  Lodge,and  a  gentleman  sprang  out.   He  was  a  remark-ably  handsome  man,  dark,  aquiline,  and  mous-tached—evidently the man of whom I had heard.He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to thecabman to wait, and brushed past the maid whoopened the door with the air of a man who wasthoroughly at home.“He was in the house about half an hour, andI could catch glimpses of him in the windows ofthe sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking ex-citedly, and waving his arms.  Of her I could seenothing. Presently he emerged, looking even moreflurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab,he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and lookedat  it  earnestly,  ‘Drive  like  the  devil,’  he  shouted,‘first  to  Gross  &  Hankey’s  in  Regent  Street,  andthen to the Church of St. Monica in the EdgewareRoad. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’“Away  they  went,  and  I  was  just  wonderingwhether I should not do well to follow them whenup the lane came a neat little landau, the coachmanwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie underhis ear, while all the tags of his harness were stick-ing out of the buckles.  It hadn’t pulled up beforeshe  shot  out  of  the  hall  door  and  into  it.   I  onlycaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she wasa lovely woman, with a face that a man might diefor.“ ‘The Church of St. Monica,  John,’  she cried,‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty min-utes.’“This  was  quite  too  good  to  lose,  Watson.   Iwas just balancing whether I should run for it, orwhether I should perch behind her landau whena cab came through the street.  The driver lookedtwice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in beforehe could object.  ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ saidI,  ‘and  half  a  sovereign  if  you  reach  it  in  twentyminutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, andof course it was clear enough what was in the wind.“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drovefaster, but the others were there before us. The caband the landau with their steaming horses were infront of the door when I arrived.  I paid the manand hurried into the church. There was not a soulthere  save  the  two  whom  I  had  followed  and  asurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostu-lating with them.  They were all three standing ina knot in front of the altar.  I lounged up the sideaisle like any other idler who has dropped into achurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at thealtar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton camerunning as hard as he could towards me.“ ‘Thank  God,’  he  cried.   ‘You’ll  do.   Come!Come!’“ ‘What then?’ I asked.“ ‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or itwon’t be legal.’“I  was  half-dragged  up  to  the  altar,  and  be-fore I knew where I was I found myself mumblingresponses which were whispered in my ear, andvouching for things of which I knew nothing, andgenerally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene10
A Scandal inBohemiaAdler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It wasall done in an instant, and there was the gentlemanthanking me on the one side and the lady on theother, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.It was the most preposterous position in which Iever found myself in my life, and it was the thoughtof it that started me laughing just now.  It seemsthat there had been some informality about theirlicense,  that the clergyman absolutely refused tomarry them without a witness of some sort, andthat my lucky appearance saved the bridegroomfrom having to sally out into the streets in searchof a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, andI mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory ofthe occasion.”“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” saidI; “and what then?”“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.It looked as if the pair might take an immediatedeparture, and so necessitate very prompt and en-ergetic measures on my part.  At the church door,however,  they  separated,  he  driving  back  to  theTemple, and she to her own house.  ‘I shall driveout  in  the  park  at  five  as  usual,’  she  said  as  sheleft him. I heard no more. They drove away in dif-ferent directions, and I went off to make my ownarrangements.”“Which are?”“Some  cold  beef  and  a  glass  of  beer,”  he  an-swered,  ringing  the  bell.   “I  have  been  too  busyto think of food, and I am likely to be busier stillthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want yourco-operation.”“I shall be delighted.”“You don’t mind breaking the law?”“Not in the least.”“Nor running a chance of arrest?”“Not in a good cause.”“Oh, the cause is excellent!”“Then I am your man.”“I was sure that I might rely on you.”“But what is it you wish?”“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray Iwill  make  it  clear  to  you.   Now,”  he  said  as  heturned hungrily on the simple fare that our land-lady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat,for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. Intwo hours we must be on the scene of action. MissIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive atseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”“And what then?”“You must leave that to me.  I have already ar-ranged what is to occur. There is only one point onwhich I must insist. You must not interfere, comewhat may. You understand?”“I am to be neutral?”“To do nothing whatever. There will probablybe some small unpleasantness.  Do not join in it.It will end in my being conveyed into the house.Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-roomwindow will open. You are to station yourself closeto that open window.”“Yes.”“You are to watch me,  for I will be visible toyou.”“Yes.”“And  when  I  raise  my  hand—so—you  willthrow into the room what I give you to throw, andwill,  at  the  same  time,  raise  the  cry  of  fire.   Youquite follow me?”“Entirely.”“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, takinga long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is anordinary plumber ’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a capat either end to make it self-lighting.  Your task isconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, itwill be taken up by quite a number of people. Youmay then walk to the end of the street, and I willrejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have mademyself clear?”“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window,to  watch  you,  and  at  the  signal  to  throw  in  thisobject, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait youat the corner of the street.”“Precisely.”“Then you may entirely rely on me.”“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almosttime that I prepare for the new role I have to play.”He disappeared into his bedroom and returnedin  a  few  minutes  in  the  character  of  an  amiableand simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. Hisbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie,his sympathetic smile, and general look of peeringand  benevolent  curiosity  were  such  as  Mr.  JohnHare alone could have equalled. It was not merelythat Holmes changed his costume. His expression,his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with ev-ery fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fineactor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, whenhe became a specialist in crime.It  was  a  quarter  past  six  when  we  left  BakerStreet, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hourwhen we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. Itwas already dusk, and the lamps were just being11
A Scandal inBohemialighted as we paced up and down in front of BrionyLodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. Thehouse was just such as I had pictured it from Sher-lock Holmes’ succinct description, but the localityappeared  to  be  less  private  than  I  expected.   Onthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbour-hood,  it was remarkably animated.  There was agroup of shabbily dressed men smoking and laugh-ing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel,two  guardsmen  who  were  flirting  with  a  nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who werelounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced toand fro in front of the house, “this marriage rathersimplifies  matters.    The  photograph  becomes  adouble-edged weapon now.  The chances are thatshe  would  be  as  averse  to  its  being  seen  by  Mr.Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to theeyes of his princess. Now the question is—Whereare we to find the photograph?”“Where, indeed?”“It is most unlikely that she carries it about withher.  It is cabinet size.  Too large for easy conceal-ment about a woman’s dress.  She knows that theKing is capable of having her waylaid and searched.Two attempts of the sort have already been made.We  may  take  it,  then,  that  she  does  not  carry  itabout with her.”“Where, then?”“Her banker or her lawyer.  There is that dou-ble possibility.  But I am inclined to think neither.Women are naturally secretive, and they like to dotheir own secreting. Why should she hand it overto anyone else? She could trust her own guardian-ship, but she could not tell what indirect or politicalinfluence might be brought to bear upon a businessman. Besides, remember that she had resolved touse  it  within  a  few  days.   It  must  be  where  shecan lay her hands upon it.  It must be in her ownhouse.”“But it has twice been burgled.”“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”“But how will you look?”“I will not look.”“What then?”“I will get her to show me.”“But she will refuse.”“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumbleof wheels.  It is her carriage.  Now carry out myorders to the letter.”As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of acarriage came round the curve of the avenue.  Itwas a smart little landau which rattled up to thedoor of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of theloafing men at the corner dashed forward to openthe door in the hope of earning a copper, but waselbowed away by another loafer, who had rushedup with the same intention. A fierce quarrel brokeout, which was increased by the two guardsmen,who took sides with one of the loungers, and bythe scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon theother side.  A blow was struck, and in an instantthe lady, who had stepped from her carriage, wasthe centre of a little knot of flushed and strugglingmen, who struck savagely at each other with theirfists  and  sticks.   Holmes  dashed  into  the  crowdto protect the lady; but just as he reached her hegave a cry and dropped to the ground,  with theblood  running  freely  down  his  face.   At  his  fallthe guardsmen took to their heels in one directionand the loungers in the other, while a number ofbetter-dressed people, who had watched the scufflewithout taking part in it, crowded in to help thelady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler,as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; butshe stood at the top with her superb figure outlinedagainst the lights of the hall, looking back into thestreet.“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.“He is dead,” cried several voices.“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another.“But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospi-tal.”“He’s  a  brave  fellow,”  said  a  woman.   “Theywould have had the lady’s purse and watch if ithadn’t  been  for  him.   They  were  a  gang,  and  arough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in,marm?”“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. Thereis a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”Slowly and solemnly he was borne into BrionyLodge and laid out in the principal room,  whileI still observed the proceedings from my post bythe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blindshad not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes ashe lay upon the couch. I do not know whether hewas seized with compunction at that moment forthe part he was playing, but I know that I never feltmore heartily ashamed of myself in my life thanwhen I saw the beautiful creature against whom Iwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness withwhich she waited upon the injured man. And yet itwould be the blackest treachery to Holmes to drawback  now  from  the  part  which  he  had  intrusted12
A Scandal inBohemiato me.  I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.  After all, I thought,we are not injuring her. We are but preventing herfrom injuring another.Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I sawhim motion like a man who is in need of air.  Amaid rushed across and threw open the window.At the same instant I saw him raise his hand andat the signal I tossed my rocket into the room witha cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of mymouth  than  the  whole  crowd  of  spectators,  welldressed and ill—gentlemen,  ostlers,  and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thickclouds of smoke curled through the room and outat the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushingfigures, and a moment later the voice of Holmesfrom within assuring them that it was a false alarm.Slipping through the shouting crowd I made myway to the corner of the street, and in ten minuteswas rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, andto get away from the scene of uproar.  He walkedswiftly and in silence for some few minutes untilwe had turned down one of the quiet streets whichlead towards the Edgeware Road.“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked.“Nothing could have been better. It is all right.”“You have the photograph?”“I know where it is.”“And how did you find out?”“She showed me, as I told you she would.”“I am still in the dark.”“I  do  not  wish  to  make  a  mystery,”  said  he,laughing.  “The matter was perfectly simple.  You,of course, saw that everyone in the street was an ac-complice. They were all engaged for the evening.”“I guessed as much.”“Then, when the row broke out, I had a littlemoist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushedforward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face,and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”“That also I could fathom.”“Then they carried me in.  She was bound tohave  me  in.   What  else  could  she  do?   And  intoher sitting-room, which was the very room whichI suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom,and I was determined to see which. They laid meon a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelledto open the window, and you had your chance.”“How did that help you?”“It was all-important.  When a woman thinksthat her house is on fire, her instinct is at once torush  to  the  thing  which  she  values  most.   It  is  aperfectly overpowering impulse, and I have morethan once taken advantage of it. In the case of theDarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me,and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A mar-ried woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried onereaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to methat our lady of to-day had nothing in the housemore precious to her than what we are in quest of.She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire wasadmirably  done.   The  smoke  and  shouting  wereenough  to shake  nerves  of steel.  She respondedbeautifully.  The photograph is in a recess behinda sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.  Shewas there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse ofit as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that itwas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at therocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seenher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escapedfrom the house. I hesitated whether to attempt tosecure the photograph at once; but the coachmanhad come in, and as he was watching me narrowlyit seemed safer to wait.  A little over-precipitancemay ruin all.”“And now?” I asked.“Our quest is practically finished.  I shall callwith  the  King  to-morrow,  and  with  you,  if  youcare to come with us.  We will be shown into thesitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probablethat when she comes she may find neither us northe photograph.  It might be a satisfaction to hisMajesty to regain it with his own hands.”“And when will you call?”“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, sothat we shall have a clear field.  Besides, we mustbe prompt, for this marriage may mean a completechange in her life and habits.  I must wire to theKing without delay.”We had reached Baker Street and had stoppedat the door.  He was searching his pockets for thekey when someone passing said:“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”There were several people on the pavement atthe time, but the greeting appeared to come from aslim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, star-ing down the dimly lit street. “Now, I wonder whothe deuce that could have been.”13
A Scandal inBohemiaCHAPTER III.I slept at Baker Street that night, and we wereengaged upon our toast and coffee in the morningwhen the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sher-lock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerlyinto his face.“Not yet.”“But you have hopes?”“I have hopes.”“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”“We must have a cab.”“No, my brougham is waiting.”“Then   that   will   simplify   matters.”   We   de-scended  and  started  off  once  more  for  BrionyLodge.“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.“Married! When?”“Yesterday.”“But to whom?”“To an English lawyer named Norton.”“But she could not love him.”“I am in hopes that she does.”“And why in hopes?”“Because it would spare your Majesty all fearof future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband,she does not love your Majesty. If she does not loveyour Majesty, there is no reason why she shouldinterfere with your Majesty’s plan.”“It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had beenof my own station! What a queen she would havemade!” He relapsed into a moody silence, whichwas  not  broken  until  we  drew  up  in  SerpentineAvenue.The  door  of  Briony  Lodge  was  open,  and  anelderly woman stood upon the steps. She watchedus  with  a  sardonic  eye  as  we  stepped  from  thebrougham.“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion,looking at her with a questioning and rather star-tled gaze.“Indeed!  My mistress told me that you werelikely to call.  She left this morning with her hus-band by the5.15train from Charing Cross for theContinent.”“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, whitewith chagrin and surprise. “Do you mean that shehas left England?”“Never to return.”“And  the  papers?”  asked  the  King  hoarsely.“All is lost.”“We  shall  see.”  He  pushed  past  the  servantand  rushed  into  the  drawing-room,  followed  bythe King and myself. The furniture was scatteredabout in every direction, with dismantled shelvesand open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ran-sacked them before her flight.  Holmes rushed atthe bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph anda letter.  The photograph was of Irene Adler her-self in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to“Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” Myfriend tore it open and we all three read it together.It  was  dated  at  midnight  of  the  preceding  nightand ran in this way:“My dearMr. SherlockHolmes:“You really did it very well. You tookme in completely. Until after the alarmof fire, I had not a suspicion. But then,when I found how I had betrayed my-self, I began to think. I had been warnedagainst  you  months  ago.   I  had  beentold that if the King employed an agentit  would  certainly  be  you.   And  youraddress had been given me.  Yet, withall this, you made me reveal what youwanted to know.  Even after I becamesuspicious, I found it hard to think evilof such a dear, kind old clergyman. But,you  know,  I  have  been  trained  as  anactress myself.  Male costume is noth-ing new to me.  I often take advantageof  the  freedom  which  it  gives.   I  sentJohn, the coachman, to watch you, ranup stairs, got into my walking-clothes,as I call them, and came down just asyou departed.“Well,  I  followed  you  to  your  door,and so made sure that I was really anobject of interest to the celebrated Mr.Sherlock  Holmes.   Then  I,  rather  im-prudently, wished you good-night, andstarted for the Temple to see my hus-band.“We  both  thought  the  best  resourcewas   flight,when    pursued   by   soformidable an antagonist;  so you willfind the nest empty when you call to-morrow.   As  to  the  photograph,  yourclient may rest in peace. I love and am14
A Scandal inBohemialoved  by  a  better  man  than  he.   TheKing may do what he will without hin-drance from one whom he has cruellywronged.   I  keep  it  only  to  safeguardmyself, and to preserve a weapon whichwill always secure me from any stepswhich  he  might  take  in  the  future.   Ileave a photograph which he might careto possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sher-lock Holmes,— “Very truly yours,“IreneNorton, n ́ee Adler.”“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried theKing of Bohemia, when we had all three read thisepistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resoluteshe was? Would she not have made an admirablequeen?   Is  it  not  a  pity  that  she  was  not  on  mylevel?”“From what I have seen of the lady she seems in-deed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,”said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have not beenable to bring your Majesty’s business to a more suc-cessful conclusion.”“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King;“nothing could be more successful. I know that herword is inviolate.  The photograph is now as safeas if it were in the fire.”“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell mein what way I can reward you.  This ring—” Heslipped an emerald snake ring from his finger andheld it out upon the palm of his hand.“Your Majesty has something which I shouldvalue even more highly,” said Holmes.“You have but to name it.”“This photograph!”The King stared at him in amazement.“Irene’s photograph!” he cried.  “Certainly,  ifyou wish it.”“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more tobe done in the matter.  I have the honour to wishyou a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turningaway without observing the hand which the Kinghad stretched out to him, he set off in my companyfor his chambers.And that was how a great scandal threatenedto  affect  the  kingdom  of  Bohemia,  and  how  thebest plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by awoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the clev-erness of women, but I have not heard him do it oflate. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or whenhe refers to her photograph, it is always under thehonourable title ofthewoman
A Case ofIdentityMy dearfellow,” said Sherlock Holmes aswe  sat  on  either  side  of  the  fire  in  hislodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitelystranger than anything which the mindof man could invent. We would not dare to conceivethe things which are really mere commonplaces ofexistence. If we could fly out of that window handin hand, hover over this great city, gently removethe roofs, and peep in at the queer things which aregoing on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events,working through generations, and leading to themost outr ́e results, it would make all fiction withits conventionalities and foreseen conclusions moststale and unprofitable.”“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered.“The cases which come to light in the papers are, asa rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We havein our police reports realism pushed to its extremelimits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,neither fascinating nor artistic.”“A certain selection and discretion must be usedin producing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes.“This is wanting in the police report, where morestress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of themagistrate than upon the details, which to an ob-server contain the vital essence of the whole matter.Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural asthe commonplace.”I smiled and shook my head.  “I can quite un-derstand your thinking so.” I said.  “Of course, inyour position of unofficial adviser and helper toeverybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughoutthree continents, you are brought in contact withall that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I pickedup the morning paper from the ground—“let usput it to a practical test.  Here is the first headingupon which I come.  ‘A husband’s cruelty to hiswife.’  There is half a column of print, but I knowwithout reading it that it is all perfectly familiar tome. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink,the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sis-ter or landlady. The crudest of writers could inventnothing more crude.”“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate onefor your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paperand glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundasseparation case, and, as it happens, I was engagedin clearing up some small points in connection withit. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no otherwoman, and the conduct complained of was that hehad drifted into the habit of winding up every mealby taking out his false teeth and hurling them at hiswife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely tooccur to the imagination of the average story-teller.Take  a  pinch  of  snuff,  Doctor,  and  acknowledgethat I have scored over you in your example.”He  held  out  his  snuffbox  of  old  gold,  with  agreat amethyst in the centre of the lid.  Its splen-dour was in such contrast to his homely ways andsimple life that I could not help commenting uponit.“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen youfor some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the Kingof Bohemia in return for my assistance in the caseof the Irene Adler papers.”“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remark-able brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.“It  was  from  the  reigning  family  of  Holland,though the matter in which I served them was ofsuch delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you,who have been good enough to chronicle one ortwo of my little problems.”“And have you any on hand just now?” I askedwith interest.“Some ten or twelve, but none which presentany feature of interest.  They are important,  youunderstand, without being interesting.  Indeed, Ihave found that it is usually in unimportant mat-ters that there is a field for the observation, and forthe quick analysis of cause and effect which givesthe charm to an investigation.  The larger crimesare apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crimethe more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In thesecases,  save  for  one  rather  intricate  matter  whichhas been referred to me from Marseilles, there isnothing which presents any features of interest. Itis  possible,  however,  that  I  may  have  somethingbetter before very many minutes are over, for thisis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”He had risen from his chair and was standingbetween the parted blinds gazing down into thedull  neutral-tinted  London  street.   Looking  overhis shoulder, I saw that on the pavement oppositethere stood a large woman with a heavy fur boaround her neck, and a large curling red feather ina broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquet-tish  Duchess  of  Devonshire  fashion  over  her  ear.From under this great panoply she peeped up in anervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, whileher body oscillated backward and forward, and herfingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly,with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves thebank, she hurried across the road, and we heardthe sharp clang of the bell.“I  have  seen  those  symptoms  before,”  saidHolmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “Oscil-lation upon the pavement always means anaffaire33
A Case ofIdentityde coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure thatthe matter is not too delicate for communication.And yet even here we may discriminate.  When awoman has been seriously wronged by a man sheno longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is abroken bell wire. Here we may take it that there isa love matter, but that the maiden is not so muchangry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comesin person to resolve our doubts.”As he spoke there was a tap at the door, andthe boy in buttons entered to announce Miss MarySutherland, while the lady herself loomed behindhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man  behind  a  tiny  pilot  boat.   Sherlock  Holmeswelcomed her with the easy courtesy for which hewas remarkable, and, having closed the door andbowed her into an armchair, he looked her over inthe minute and yet abstracted fashion which waspeculiar to him.“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your shortsight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?”“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I knowwhere the letters are without looking.” Then, sud-denly realising the full purport of his words, shegave a violent start and looked up, with fear and as-tonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face.“You’ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried,“else how could you know all that?”“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is mybusiness to know things.  Perhaps I have trainedmyself  to  see  what  others  overlook.   If  not,  whyshould you come to consult me?”“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you fromMrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easywhen the police and everyone had given him upfor dead.  Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would doas  much  for  me.   I’m  not  rich,  but  still  I  have  ahundred a year in my own right, besides the littlethat I make by the machine, and I would give it allto know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”“Why did you come away to consult me in sucha hurry?” asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.Again a startled look came over the somewhatvacuous  face  of  Miss  Mary  Sutherland.“Yes,I  did  bang  out  of  the  house,”  she  said,  “for  itmade me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.Windibank—that  is,  my  father—took  it  all.   Hewould not go to the police, and he would not goto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing andkept  on  saying  that  there  was  no  harm  done,  itmade me mad, and I just on with my things andcame right away to you.”“Your  father,”  said  Holmes,  “your  stepfather,surely, since the name is different.”“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though itsounds funny, too, for he is only five years and twomonths older than myself.”“And your mother is alive?”“Oh,  yes,  mother  is  alive  and  well.   I  wasn’tbest pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married againso soon after father’s death, and a man who wasnearly fifteen years younger than herself.  Fatherwas a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, andhe left a tidy business behind him, which mothercarried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but whenMr. Windibank came he made her sell the business,for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.They got£4700for the goodwill and interest, whichwasn’t near as much as father could have got if hehad been alive.”I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impa-tient under this rambling and inconsequential nar-rative, but, on the contrary, he had listened withthe greatest concentration of attention.“Your  own  little  income,”  he  asked,  “does  itcome out of the business?”“Oh,  no,  sir.  It is quite separate and was leftme by my uncle Ned in Auckland.  It is in NewZealand stock, paying41/2per cent. Two thousandfive hundred pounds was the amount,  but I canonly touch the interest.”“You   interest   me   extremely,”   said   Holmes.“And since you draw so large a sum as a hundreda year, with what you earn into the bargain, you nodoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in everyway.  I believe that a single lady can get on verynicely upon an income of about£60.”“I  could  do  with  much  less  than  that,   Mr.Holmes, but you understand that as long as I liveat home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, andso they have the use of the money just while I amstaying with them. Of course, that is only just forthe time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest everyquarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that Ican do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting.It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often dofrom fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”“You have made your position very clear to me,”said Holmes.  “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, be-fore whom you can speak as freely as before myself.Kindly tell us now all about your connection withMr. Hosmer Angel.”A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, andshe  picked  nervously  at  the  fringe  of  her  jacket.“I  met  him  first  at  the  gasfitters’  ball,”  she  said.“They used to send father tickets when he was alive,34
A Case ofIdentityand then afterwards they remembered us, and sentthem to mother.  Mr. Windibank did not wish usto go.  He never did wish us to go anywhere.  Hewould get quite mad if I wanted so much as to joina Sunday-school treat.  But this time I was set ongoing,  and I would go;  for what right had he toprevent?   He  said  the  folk  were  not  fit  for  us  toknow,  when all father’s friends were to be there.And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when Ihad my purple plush that I had never so much astaken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing elsewould do, he went off to France upon the businessof the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr.Hardy,  who  used  to  be our  foreman,  and  it  wasthere I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”“I  suppose,”  said  Holmes,   “that  when  Mr.Windibank  came  back  from  France  he  was  veryannoyed at your having gone to the ball.”“Oh,  well,  he  was  very  good  about  it.    Helaughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders,and said there was no use denying anything to awoman, for she would have her way.”“I see.  Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, asI understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer An-gel.”“Yes,  sir.  I met him that night,  and he callednext day to ask if we had got home all safe, andafter that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, Imet him twice for walks, but after that father cameback again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not cometo the house any more.”“No?”“Well, you know father didn’t like anything ofthe sort. He wouldn’t have any visitors if he couldhelp it, and he used to say that a woman should behappy in her own family circle. But then, as I usedto say to mother, a woman wants her own circle tobegin with, and I had not got mine yet.”“But  how  about  Mr.  Hosmer  Angel?   Did  hemake no attempt to see you?”“Well, father was going off to France again ina week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it wouldbe safer and better not to see each other until hehad gone. We could write in the meantime, and heused to write every day. I took the letters in in themorning, so there was no need for father to know.”“Were  you  engaged  to  the  gentleman  at  thistime?”“Oh,  yes,  Mr.  Holmes.   We  were  engaged  af-ter  the  first  walk  that  we  took.Hosmer—Mr.Angel—was  a  cashier  in  an  office  in  LeadenhallStreet—and—”“What office?”“That’s  the  worst  of  it,  Mr.  Holmes,  I  don’tknow.”“Where did he live, then?”“He slept on the premises.”“And you don’t know his address?”“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”“Where did you address your letters, then?”“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be lefttill called for. He said that if they were sent to theoffice he would be chaffed by all the other clerksabout  having  letters  from  a  lady,  so  I  offered  totypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’thave that, for he said that when I wrote them theyseemed to come from me, but when they were type-written he always felt that the machine had comebetween us. That will just show you how fond hewas of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that hewould think of.”“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It haslong been an axiom of mine that the little things areinfinitely the most important. Can you rememberany other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He wouldrather walk with me in the evening than in the day-light, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.Very  retiring  and  gentlemanly  he  was.   Even  hisvoice was gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollenglands  when  he  was  young,  he  told  me,  and  ithad left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,whispering fashion of speech. He was always welldressed,  very  neat  and  plain,  but  his  eyes  wereweak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glassesagainst the glare.”“Well,andwhathappenedwhenMr.Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?”“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house againand proposed that we should marry before fathercame back. He was in dreadful earnest and mademe swear, with my hands on the Testament, thatwhatever happened I would always be true to him.Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,and that it was a sign of his passion.  Mother wasall in his favour from the first and was even fonderof him than I was. Then, when they talked of mar-rying within the week, I began to ask about father;but they both said never to mind about father, butjust  to  tell  him  afterwards,  and  mother  said  shewould make it all right with him. I didn’t quite likethat, Mr. Holmes.  It seemed funny that I shouldask his leave, as he was only a few years older thanme; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, soI wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company35
A Case ofIdentityhas its French offices, but the letter came back tome on the very morning of the wedding.”“It missed him, then?”“Yes,  sir;  for  he  had  started  to  England  justbefore it arrived.”“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding wasarranged,  then,  for  the  Friday.   Was  it  to  be  inchurch?”“Yes,  sir,  but  very  quietly.   It  was  to  be  at  St.Saviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to havebreakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hos-mer came for us in a hansom, but as there were twoof us he put us both into it and stepped himselfinto a four-wheeler, which happened to be the onlyother cab in the street.  We got to the church first,and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited forhim to step out, but he never did, and when thecabman got down from the box and looked therewas no one there!  The cabman said that he couldnot imagine what had become of him, for he hadseen him get in with his own eyes.  That was lastFriday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heardanything since then to throw any light upon whatbecame of him.”“It seems to me that you have been very shame-fully treated,” said Holmes.“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leaveme so. Why, all the morning he was saying to methat,  whatever  happened,  I  was  to  be  true;  andthat even if something quite unforeseen occurredto  separate  us,  I  was  always  to  remember  that  Iwas pledged to him, and that he would claim hispledge sooner or later.  It seemed strange talk fora wedding-morning, but what has happened sincegives a meaning to it.”“Most certainly it does.  Your own opinion is,then,  that  some  unforeseen  catastrophe  has  oc-curred to him?”“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger,or else he would not have talked so.  And then Ithink that what he foresaw happened.”“But  you  have  no  notion  as  to  what  it  couldhave been?”“None.”“One  more  question.   How  did  your  mothertake the matter?”“She was angry,  and said that I was never tospeak of the matter again.”“And your father? Did you tell him?”“Yes;  and  he  seemed  to  think,  with  me,  thatsomething had happened, and that I should hear ofHosmer again. As he said, what interest could any-one have in bringing me to the doors of the church,and  then leaving me?  Now,  if  he had  borrowedmy money,  or if he had married me and got mymoney settled on him, there might be some reason,but Hosmer was very independent about moneyand never would look at a shilling of mine.  Andyet, what could have happened?  And why couldhe not write?  Oh, it drives me half-mad to thinkof it, and I can’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulleda little handkerchief out of her muff and began tosob heavily into it.“I  shall  glance  into  the  case  for  you,”  saidHolmes, rising, “and I have no doubt that we shallreach some definite result.  Let the weight of thematter rest upon me now, and do not let your minddwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hos-mer Angel vanish from your memory,  as he hasdone from your life.”“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”“I fear not.”“Then what has happened to him?”“You will leave that question in my hands.  Ishould like an accurate description of him and anyletters of his which you can spare.”“I advertised for him in last Saturday’sChron-icle,” said she.  “Here is the slip and here are fourletters from him.”“Thank you. And your address?”“No.31Lyon Place, Camberwell.”“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I under-stand. Where is your father’s place of business?”“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the greatclaret importers of Fenchurch Street.”“Thank  you.   You  have  made  your  statementvery clearly.  You will leave the papers here, andremember the advice which I have given you. Letthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do notallow it to affect your life.”“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannotdo that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find meready when he comes back.”For all the preposterous hat and the vacuousface, there was something noble in the simple faithof our visitor which compelled our respect. She laidher little bundle of papers upon the table and wenther way, with a promise to come again whenevershe might be summoned.Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minuteswith his fingertips still pressed together, his legsstretched out in front of him, and his gaze directedupward to the ceiling. Then he took down from therack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him asa counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his36
A Case ofIdentitychair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinningup from him, and a look of infinite languor in hisface.“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” heobserved.  “I found her more interesting than herlittle problem, which, by the way, is rather a triteone. You will find parallel cases, if you consult myindex, in Andover in ’77, and there was somethingof the sort at The Hague last year.  Old as is theidea, however, there were one or two details whichwere new to me. But the maiden herself was mostinstructive.”“You appeared to read a good deal upon herwhich was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You didnot  know  where  to  look,  and  so  you  missed  allthat was important.  I can never bring you to re-alise the importance of sleeves, the suggestivenessof thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hangfrom a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather fromthat woman’s appearance? Describe it.”“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmedstraw  hat,  with  a  feather  of  a  brickish  red.   Herjacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it,and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dresswas brown, rather darker than coffee colour, witha little purple plush at the neck and sleeves.  Hergloves were greyish and were worn through at theright forefinger.  Her boots I didn’t observe.  Shehad  small  round,  hanging  gold  earrings,  and  ageneral air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar,comfortable, easy-going way.”Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly to-gether and chuckled.“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming alongwonderfully.   You  have  really  done  very  well  in-deed.  It is true that you have missed everythingof importance, but you have hit upon the method,and you have a quick eye for colour.  Never trustto  general  impressions,  my  boy,  but  concentrateyourself upon details. My first glance is always ata  woman’s  sleeve.   In  a  man  it  is  perhaps  betterfirst to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe,this  woman  had  plush  upon  her  sleeves,  whichis a most useful material for showing traces.  Thedouble line a little above the wrist, where the type-writist  presses  against  the  table,  was  beautifullydefined.   The  sewing-machine,  of  the  hand  type,leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, andon the side of it farthest from the thumb, insteadof being right across the broadest part, as this was.I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dintof a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventureda remark upon short sight and typewriting, whichseemed to surprise her.”“It surprised me.”“But, surely, it was obvious.  I was then muchsurprised and interested on glancing down to ob-serve that, though the boots which she was wearingwere not unlike each other, they were really oddones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap,and the other a plain one. One was buttoned onlyin the two lower buttons out of five, and the otherat the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see thata young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has comeaway from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, itis no great deduction to say that she came away ina hurry.”“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, asI always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.“I noted, in passing, that she had written a notebefore leaving home but after being fully dressed.You observed that her right glove was torn at theforefinger, but you did not apparently see that bothglove and finger were stained with violet ink. Shehad  written  in  a  hurry  and  dipped  her  pen  toodeep. It must have been this morning, or the markwould not remain clear upon the finger. All this isamusing, though rather elementary, but I must goback to business, Watson.  Would you mind read-ing me the advertised description of Mr. HosmerAngel?”I held the little printed slip to the light.“Missing,”  it  said,  “on  the  morningof the fourteenth, a gentleman namedHosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in.in  height;  strongly  built,  sallow  com-plexion, black hair, a little bald in thecentre, bushy, black side-whiskers andmoustache;  tinted  glasses,  slight  infir-mity  of  speech.    Was  dressed,  whenlast seen, in black frock-coat faced withsilk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,and  grey  Harris  tweed  trousers,  withbrown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.Known  to  have  been  employed  in  anoffice  in  Leadenhall  Street.   Anybodybringing—”“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,”he continued, glancing over them, “they are verycommonplace.  Absolutely no clue in them to Mr.Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is oneremarkable point,  however,  which will no doubtstrike you.”“They are typewritten,” I remarked.37
A Case ofIdentity“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten.Look at the neat little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom.There is a date, you see, but no superscription ex-cept Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. Thepoint  about  the  signature  is  very  suggestive—infact, we may call it conclusive.”“Of what?”“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not seehow strongly it bears upon the case?”“I cannot say that I do unless it were that hewished to be able to deny his signature if an actionfor breach of promise were instituted.”“No, that was not the point.  However, I shallwrite two letters,  which should settle the matter.One  is  to  a  firm  in  the  City,  the  other  is  to  theyoung  lady’s  stepfather,  Mr.  Windibank,  askinghim whether he could meet us here at six o’clocktomorrow evening. It is just as well that we shoulddo business with the male relatives. And now, Doc-tor, we can do nothing until the answers to thoseletters come, so we may put our little problem uponthe shelf for the interim.”I  had  had  so  many  reasons  to  believe  in  myfriend’s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordi-nary energy in action that I felt that he must havesome solid grounds for the assured and easy de-meanour with which he treated the singular mys-tery  which  he  had  been  called  upon  to  fathom.Once  only  had  I  known  him  to  fail,  in  the  caseof  the  King  of  Bohemia  and  of  the  Irene  Adlerphotograph; but when I looked back to the weirdbusiness of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinarycircumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet,I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed whichhe could not unravel.I  left  him  then,  still  puffing  at  his  black  claypipe, with the conviction that when I came againon the next evening I would find that he held inhis hands all the clues which would lead up to theidentity of the disappearing bridegroom of MissMary Sutherland.A professional case of great gravity was engag-ing my own attention at the time, and the whole ofnext day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.It was not until close upon six o’clock that I foundmyself free and was able to spring into a hansomand drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I mightbe too late to assist at the d ́enouement of the littlemystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however,half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up inthe recesses of his armchair.  A formidable arrayof bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanlysmell  of  hydrochloric  acid,  told  me  that  he  hadspent his day in the chemical work which was sodear to him.“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have beenworking upon.  There was never any mystery inthe matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of thedetails are of interest.  The only drawback is thatthere is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”“Who was he, then, and what was his object indeserting Miss Sutherland?”The question was hardly out of my mouth, andHolmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, whenwe heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tapat the door.“This   is   the   girl’s   stepfather,    Mr.   JamesWindibank,” said Holmes. “He has written to meto say that he would be here at six. Come in!”The  man  who  entered  was  a  sturdy,  middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven,and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating man-ner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrat-ing grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at eachof us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard,and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearestchair.“Good-evening,  Mr.  James  Windibank,”  saidHolmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is fromyou, in which you made an appointment with mefor six o’clock?”“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but Iam not quite my own master, you know. I am sorrythat Miss Sutherland has troubled you about thislittle matter, for I think it is far better not to washlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against mywishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and sheis not easily controlled when she has made up hermind on a point.  Of course, I did not mind youso much,  as you are not connected with the offi-cial police, but it is not pleasant to have a familymisfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is auseless expense, for how could you possibly findthis Hosmer Angel?”“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I haveevery reason to believe that I will succeed in dis-covering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and droppedhis gloves. “I am delighted to hear it,” he said.“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “thata typewriter has really quite as much individualityas a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new,no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get38
A Case ofIdentitymore worn than others, and some wear only on oneside.  Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr.Windibank, that in every case there is some littleslurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tailof the ‘r.’  There are fourteen other characteristics,but those are the more obvious.”“We do all our correspondence with this ma-chine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,”our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmeswith his bright little eyes.“And now I will show you what is really a veryinteresting study, Mr. Windibank,” Holmes contin-ued. “I think of writing another little monographsome of these days on the typewriter and its rela-tion to crime. It is a subject to which I have devotedsome little attention. I have here four letters whichpurport to come from the missing man.  They areall typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’slurred and the ‘r ’s’ tailless, but you will observe, ifyou care to use my magnifying lens, that the four-teen other characteristics to which I have alludedare there as well.”Mr.  Windibank  sprang  out  of  his  chair  andpicked up his hat.  “I cannot waste time over thissort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If youcan  catch  the  man,  catch  him,  and  let  me  knowwhen you have done it.”“Certainly,”  said  Holmes,  stepping  over  andturning the key in the door. “I let you know, then,that I have caught him!”“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turn-ing white to his lips and glancing about him like arat in a trap.“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmessuavely. “There is no possible getting out of it, Mr.Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it wasa very bad compliment when you said that it wasimpossible  for  me  to  solve  so  simple  a  question.That’s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.”Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastlyface and a glitter of moisture on his brow. “It—it’snot actionable,” he stammered.“I am very much afraid that it is not.  But be-tween ourselves,  Windibank,  it was as cruel andselfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as evercame  before  me.   Now,  let  me  just  run  over  thecourse of events, and you will contradict me if I gowrong.”The man sat huddled up in his chair, with hishead sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterlycrushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner ofthe mantelpiece and, leaning back with his handsin his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, asit seemed, than to us.“The man married a woman very much olderthan himself for her money,” said he, “and he en-joyed the use of the money of the daughter as longas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum,for people in their position, and the loss of it wouldhave made a serious difference.  It was worth aneffort to preserve it.  The daughter was of a good,amiable  disposition,  but  affectionate  and  warm-hearted  in  her  ways,  so  that  it  was  evident  thatwith  her  fair  personal  advantages,  and  her  littleincome, she would not be allowed to remain singlelong.  Now her marriage would mean, of course,the  loss  of  a  hundred  a  year,  so  what  does  herstepfather do to prevent it?  He takes the obviouscourse of keeping her at home and forbidding herto seek the company of people of her own age. Butsoon he found that that would not answer forever.She became restive, insisted upon her rights, andfinally announced her positive intention of goingto a certain ball.  What does her clever stepfatherdo then? He conceives an idea more creditable tohis head than to his heart. With the connivance andassistance  of  his  wife  he  disguised  himself,  cov-ered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, maskedthe  face  with  a  moustache  and  a  pair  of  bushywhiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuatingwhisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’sshort sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, andkeeps off other lovers by making love himself.”“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor.“We  never  thought  that  she  would  have  been  socarried away.”“Very  likely  not.   However  that  may  be,  theyoung lady was very decidedly carried away, and,having quite made up her mind that her stepfatherwas in France, the suspicion of treachery never foran instant entered her mind. She was flattered bythe gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was in-creased by the loudly expressed admiration of hermother.  Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it wasobvious that the matter should be pushed as faras it would go if a real effect were to be produced.There were meetings, and an engagement, whichwould finally secure the girl’s affections from turn-ing towards anyone else. But the deception couldnot be kept up forever. These pretended journeysto France were rather cumbrous.  The thing to dowas clearly to bring the business to an end in sucha  dramatic  manner  that  it  would  leave  a  perma-nent impression upon the young lady’s mind andprevent  her  from  looking  upon  any  other  suitorfor  some  time  to  come.   Hence  those  vows  of  fi-delity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also39
A Case ofIdentitythe allusions to a possibility of something happen-ing on the very morning of the wedding.  JamesWindibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so boundto Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,that for ten years to come, at any rate, she wouldnot listen to another man. As far as the church doorhe brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,he conveniently vanished away by the old trick ofstepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and outat the other.  I think that was the chain of events,Mr. Windibank!”Our visitor had recovered something of his as-surance  while  Holmes  had  been  talking,  and  herose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon hispale face.“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” saidhe, “but if you are so very sharp you ought to besharp enough to know that it is you who are break-ing the law now, and not me. I have done nothingactionable from the first, but as long as you keepthat door locked you lay yourself open to an actionfor assault and illegal constraint.”“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” saidHolmes,  unlocking  and  throwing  open  the  door,“yet there never was a man who deserved punish-ment more.  If the young lady has a brother or afriend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoul-ders.  By Jove!” he continued,  flushing up at thesight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face,  “itis not part of my duties to my client, but here’s ahunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treatmyself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip,but before he could grasp it there was a wild clat-ter  of  steps  upon  the  stairs,  the  heavy  hall  doorbanged,  and  from  the  window  we  could  see  Mr.James Windibank running at the top of his speeddown the road.“There’s   a   cold-blooded   scoundrel!”   saidHolmes, laughing, as he threw himself down intohis chair once more.  “That fellow will rise fromcrime to crime until he does something very bad,and  ends  on  a  gallows.   The  case  has,  in  somerespects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of yourreasoning,” I remarked.“Well,  of course it was obvious from the firstthat this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strongobject for his curious conduct, and it was equallyclear that the only man who really profited by theincident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather.Then the fact that the two men were never together,but that the one always appeared when the otherwas away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spec-tacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at adisguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicionswere all confirmed by his peculiar action in type-writing  his  signature,  which,  of  course,  inferredthat  his  handwriting  was  so  familiar  to  her  thatshe would recognise even the smallest sample of it.You see all these isolated facts, together with manyminor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”“And how did you verify them?”“Having once spotted my man, it was easy toget corroboration.  I knew the firm for which thisman worked. Having taken the printed description,I eliminated everything from it which could be theresult of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, thevoice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request thatthey would inform me whether it answered to thedescription of any of their travellers. I had alreadynoticed  the  peculiarities  of  the  typewriter,  and  Iwrote to the man himself at his business addressasking him if he would come here. As I expected,his reply was typewritten and revealed the sametrivial  but  characteristic  defects.   The  same  postbrought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, ofFenchurch Street, to say that the description talliedin every respect with that of their employee, JamesWindibank. Voil`a tout!”“And Miss Sutherland?”“If I tell her she will not believe me.  You mayremember  the  old  Persian  saying,  ‘There  is  dan-ger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and dangeralso for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, andas much knowledge of the world.”40
